# A Moving Window
* As soon as your mouse enters the window, it leaves you.
* It's just a test now.
* Consider a topmost application, maybe a notepad, a calculator, a translator, or something we use frequently
   * It always happened that the app blocks our sight to the workspace
   * It may be due to not having a dual screen or just opening a new browser and inevitably changing the screen layout.
   * For this case, a moving window may be helpful.
