# A Moving Window
* As soon as your mouse enter window, it leave you.
* It's just a test now.
* Consider a topmost application, maybe a notepad, a calculator, a translator or something we uses frequently
    * It always happened that the app block our view to the workspace
    * It maybe due to not having dual screen or just opening a new browser and inevitably changing the screen layout.
    * Then, a moving window may be helpful.
